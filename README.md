6/10/22.
Game night with family.
I lost 10 consecutive games of Connect Four.
This is my revenge: I busted out my laptop and quickly wrote up a brute-force, recursively exhaustive, Python-native Connect Four assistant. 

(WIP: bug in generateNextPlay and getWinningMove that erroneously updates the game map on getWinningMove. If someone figures that out, submit a PR.)

One of those itches I just had to scratch.
